# Proposal for chairsandchairs.co.uk from [Jack Webster](https://jack-webster.co.uk)

Following our conversation regarding the updating and promotion of the website chairsandchairs.co.uk, I would like to provide you with my recommended proposal for the development of the site.

# Stage 1 - Site re-development

The first stage is for the redesign and development of the site. This is to update the look and feel of the site, make it compatible with modern browsers and devices, and update the range of products to better reflect your current range, as the existing site is somewhat out of date. This stage includes:

## Site Design
* Colours and branding similar to existing site.
* Layout similar to existing site.
    * Provide additional details on product pages.
    * Provide footer with useful information, business address.
    * Call-to-action (how to order) on product pages.
* Updated to be compatible with modern browsers.
* Responsive design - to display correctly on all devices including mobiles and tablets.
* Images optimised for fast loading and high quality.

## Site Content
* Site to consist of the following page designs:
    * Home page
        * Short paragraph about the business.
        * List of categories.
        * Information about how to order.
    * Category page (bed end benches, footstools etc)
        * Information about type of furniture, it's uses, options, how it's made.
        * List of products in the category, with photos.
    * Product page
        * Photographs of product.
        * Short text about product, uses, options, construction.
        * Details of product, dimensions, specifications.
        * Available options for product - wood/finish, fabric, feet.
        * Call-to-action, how to order.
    * Contact / Order page
        * Full contact details
        * Map
        * Order Form that sends to your e-mail address.
        * Instructions regarding how to order online / via telephone.
    * Options pages
        * Pages for leg/types colours should be included in the product pages, but can be available as a separate page too if you wish.
    * Article page (possible future addition).
        * Feature article regarding a particular bespoke product or project that you wish to feature.
* All copy and photos will need to be provided on or near commencement of the project. I will provide proofreading and editing for SEO.

**Stage one price £1500**

# Stage 2 - Basic SEO

This stage is to ensure that you do not lose any rankings in Google and other search engines and to provide a solid technical base for the site so that it can start to move higher in the organic search rankings. This includes:

* Analysis of existing site and implementation of redirects to new addresses.
    * This should help to mitigate any short-term drop in rankings from updating the site's code and content.
* Listing in Google My Business and relevant directories.
* Full site analysis.
    * Optimisation of page titles, keywords and meta descriptions.
    * Optimisation of server settings.
    * Analysis of backlink profile (links from other sites).
* Implementation of Google Webmaster Tools and Google Analytics.
* Full SEO report, this will include details of work done and recommendations for future changes, if required.

**Stage two price £900**

# Stage 3 - Monitoring and Maintenance

Once the site is complete, this stage is for ongoing work on a monthly basis to maintain, update and monitor the site. This includes:

* Monthly monitoring of Google Analytics, to review which keywords are working for your site.
* Monthly monitoring of SEO profile - including Google algorithm updates, backlinks and search engine rankings for chosen keywords and phrases.
* Monitoring of backlink opportunities and competitors.
* Uptime monitoring - making sure that the site is online and react if there is a problem with the site or the server.
* Optimisation of titles, descriptions, keywords and content in response to analytics and SEO data.
* Up to 1/2 day of additional changes and updates to your site, as requested.
  
**Stage three price: £300 per calendar month.**
