# Proposal for gatemasterlocks.com from [Jack Webster](https://jack-webster.co.uk)

I spoke this week with Ian Hetherington regarding the new website that you wish to optimise and promite in multiple countries / languages. Ian has informed me that you are looking to start with a 3-month push of SEO and Marketing, enclosed is my proposal and quote for those 3 months. All proposals include work in English (UK), English (US) and Spanish. My understanding is that French translations will be supplied.

# Month 1 - Research, Analysis and Discovery

The first month would be spent on analysis and research to make sure that we are targeting the right areas, and that we are aware of any opportunities to build on. This includes:

## Keyword planning and research
Discussion of potential and desirable keywords and research into levels of competition / possible return for potential keyword groups.
### Full site audit 
Full review of the technical aspects of the site's SEO).
### Link audit
Analysis of existing and potential backlinks to the site. May include redirects from old domains that you no longer use. Discovery of opportunities for backlinks (directories, forums, retailers).
### Competitor analysis
Analysis of competitor sites, backlink profiles and keywords targeted.
### Content plan
Plan for required content - what pages and articles do we need, what content should they include. Do we require any additional photography or videography (suggest that videos/youtube would be useful for your type of product). Producing the content plan at this stage leaves time for you to provide any information or content required and arrange photography / videos.
### Google Analytics / Webmaster tools installation
Creation and implementation of analytics accounts to monitor our progress and ensure site is being crawled and indexed correctly with Google.

At the end of this month you will receive a detailed report of all findings and an action plan for content for you to provide.

# Month 2 - Technical SEO
The second month is to modify the site's code, layout and design to provide a stable technical base for our SEO efforts.
### Implementation of results of technical audit
Fixing of any issues with the HTML code, server setup, redirects and links.
### Address backlink profile
Add site to any relevant directories, pages and forums. Disavow (remove) backlinks from sites that appear to be "spam".
### Design changes
Addressing any usability / design issues to ensure that traffic will convert well into customers.

# Month 3 - Content Creation and implementation

In month three we start to create and update the content that we have planned in the first phase according to the research and analysis. This will include new and modified pages, articles, photographs and video in the target languages and region. This will also include initial promotion of content where relevant (social media, blogs, backlinks from relevant sites).

# Cost
Price for this project would be **Â£1200 per month.** Should you wish to continue after the 3 months, I would suggest a considerably reduced budget - what I recommend here is an intensive effort to kick start the project.
